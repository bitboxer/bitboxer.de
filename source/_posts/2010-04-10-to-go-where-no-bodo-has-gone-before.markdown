Today I will do something I wanted to do for a while now. From now on I
separate my private blog from my coding stuff. This way I won't flood my
[Facebook](http://facebook.com/bodo.tasche), [Twitter](http://twitter.com/thetaesch)
and other social media stuff with coding snipplets only a few listeners will 
understand.

It will take a few days to move all content here and create project pages for
every little project.  Hopefully the move will be completed on the next
weekend.
