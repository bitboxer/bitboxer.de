I am really proud of you, [OpenStreetMap](http://openstreetmap.org). You collected tons of data. Tons and tons of it. 

For example, look at the Cologne Zoo in OpenStreetMap:



And this is how it looks like in Google Maps:



A lot of information. Even the locations of the different animals are marked on the map. I love it. I love the fact that you have tons of bike paths that are unavailable in Google Maps. But please don't show all of this information at once.

If you zoom out of Cologne, you will see what I mean:



Compare that overcrowded mess to the clean Google counterpart:



The Google Map Renderer highlights the important roads and fades out the unimportant onces. Sadly the OpenStreetMap-Renderer doesn't. A few fixes in the color schemes in the smaller zoom views and a improved rendering of street names should fix this, shouldn't it? You have tons of data, please make it look good.
