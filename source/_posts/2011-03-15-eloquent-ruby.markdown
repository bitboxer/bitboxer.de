At the moment I am sick at home and use the time to finally read some books that where on my to-do list. The first was ["Eloquent Ruby"](http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/0321584104/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=wannawork-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1638&creative=19454&creativeASIN=0321584104) by [Russ Olsen](http://eloquentruby.com/).

It got very positive reviews around the net, including Peter Cooper, who [said:](http://www.rubyinside.com/a-review-of-eloquent-ruby-by-russ-olsen-it-rocks-4432.html)



> Eloquent Ruby [...] is the first Ruby book I've read in its entirety within 24 hours; it's that good.



There is also a positive review by [Antonio Cangiano](http://programmingzen.com/2011/03/07/eloquent-ruby-review/).

What's it all about? Basically Eloquent Ruby doesn't try to teach you to write Ruby code, it tries to teach you how to write _good_ Ruby code. Not only by telling you how to write it, but also by explaining why the Ruby world choosed that certain way to do it. I have read it in one day and didn't learn much while doing so. But it was a good reminder on how and why we Ruby Developers do the stuff we do. And it was a nice read nevertheless. Russ is a  talented and very funny author. I would definitively read a book written by him even if it's about fly-fishing :) . Even better: he [reacts on tweets](https://twitter.com/#!/russolsen/status/47727509785149441) about his book.

Strong buying advice for everybody who just started to learn ruby or wants to feel more safe while coding in it.
