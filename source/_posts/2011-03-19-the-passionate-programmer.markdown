[![](http://bitboxer.de/wp-content/uploads/passionateprogrammer.png)](http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/1934356344/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=wannawork-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1638&creative=19454&creativeASIN=1934356344) The last book for this week is [The Passionate Programmer](http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/1934356344/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=wannawork-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1638&creative=19454&creativeASIN=1934356344) by [Chad Fowler](http://chadfowler.com/). 

I really want to travel back in time and give this book to my younger self. The one that was bored in his job and yelled at by a few stupid managers. To quit that job was one of the best things that happend to me. But I was forced to do it and should have done it earlier.

After reading this book you will reevaluate your live as a developer. Your chosen path. You will recheck everything. In short: this book tries to get you passionate again for your job. Don't just do it, love it. 

You will see yourself with different eyes after reading this book. At least I did. Now I have to act on it.
