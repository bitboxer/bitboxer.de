Another week, another book. [JavaScript: The Good Parts](http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/0596517742/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=wannawork-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1638&creative=19454&creativeASIN=0596517742).
But I can't recommend this book. Imagine your worst teacher. The guy who could
put you into a coma only by thinking of him. A boring guy that can't teach, but
tries to speak about fact after fact. Using huge diagrams and tons of boring
examples. And now try to imagine that this teacher tries to write a book. This
is exactly what you will get.

It's a sleeping pill in book form. Unbelievable. The author really thinks that
by showing [railroad diagrams](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_diagram) he
can explain the language. But we don't want to write a lexer for a compiler. We
want to learn good Javascript. And tons of diagrams won't help here. He even
tries to explain RegExp-parsing with those Diagrams.

And the pages where he shows how to write a JSON-Parser?! Why?! Oh my god. 

In short: stay away from this book. Really far away.
