Sorry, but I really do. Every time I am searching for stuff on amazon it will
have an effect on the start page. Articles that are similar to the search will
show up. Regardless on how embarrassing they might be. I regularly search for
gifts and I really don't want [those guys](http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B00284SCYW?ie=UTF8&tag=wannawork-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1638&creative=19454&creativeASIN=B00284SCYW)
on my landing page. 

Thinking of buying a present for your girlfriend? Never open amazon when she is
around you. Even if you bought the present a few days ago. Amazon will ruin the
surprise and show related products on your start page. Even worse: if a friend
sends a link to an amazon product as a joke, it will show up there, too.

I won't open amazon when other people look over my shoulder. Never. Because of
that.
