Another month, another [big event](http://sigint.ccc.de). It seems like Cologne is a real heaven for nerds right now. From my point of view its right behind Berlin as #2 best nerd place in Germany. [Hcking.de](http://hcking.de) is a good proof for that. Cologne should really get its act together and start to enhance its coolness factor. Stop that awkward "internet capital city" campaign and start a fresh new brand. Maybe [Made with love in Cologne](https://www.facebook.com/MadewithloveinCologne).

Most of the time I was sitting at the [cologne.rb](http://www.colognerb.de) usergroup booth to represent ruby.

Sadly the booth area was not very accepted by the audience, but it was fun nevertheless. I tried lock picking at the neighbor booth by the [SSDeV Cologne](http://wiki.ssdev.org/wiki/K%C3%B6ln).

Besides having fun at the booth area I watched only a few talks. The best by far was the [Men who stare at bits](https://program.sigint.ccc.de/fahrplan/events/64.html), which hopefully can be found on the [media.ccc.de](http://media.ccc.de) webpage soon. Udo Vetter gave his famous talk on how to deal with police called "[Sie haben das Recht zu schweigen](http://media.ccc.de/browse/congress/2006/23C3-1346-de-sie_haben_das_recht_zu_schweigen.html)". If you haven't watched it by now, you really should.

The next conference will be the [euruko](http://www.euruko2012.org/). Can't wait for it!
