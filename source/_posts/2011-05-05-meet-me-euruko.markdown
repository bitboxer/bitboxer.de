I will present a talk about arduino and ruby at the
[euruko](http://euruko2011.org) this year. Hope to see you there!

**Endless fun with Arduino and Eventmachine**

After seven years of working as a java developer, Bodo fall in love with ruby
and moved to cologne to work as a full time ruby developer. He started
tinkering with hardware as a teenager with his C-64, his dad created the robots
and he wrote the software that made them move. Besides coding Bodo loves
diving, traveling and biking.

In his talk he will show how to connect an arduino with ruby using
eventmachine. He will also show potential use cases and projects that can be
created using this technique. Most of the projects can be finished on one
weekend.

If you didn't manage to get a ticket, but you would love to talk with ruby
developers in Berlin, maybee the [eurucamp](http://eurucamp.org/) is a good
alternative for you.
