If I had to name one book that changed my life, it will be the book on the
lower right. It's the handbook of a [Commodore 64](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64). 
I will never forget the "Ahhhh" moment I got after entering the first lines of
basic into our brand new computer on christmas eve:

```
10 print "Hallo"
20 goto 10
```

![C64 Manual](http://bitboxer.de/wp-content/uploads/399px-C64-Handbuch3.jpeg) 

Actually the first lines of basic I entered into the c64 were from "Fix and
Foxy", a German magazine for kids. But after entering the few examples from
that little magazine, I started reading the handbook. And I started to
understand what I just wrote. 

Nowadays "handbook" means a PDF on a disc that only shows how to do very basic
things. In the 80s, it was more than that. Way more. It covered everything from
first steps in basic to a few examples on how to access the graphic memory to
create images and move them around on the screen. And it was well written. Well
enough for a child to understand it. Well enough for me to start writing my
first few little games.

It ignited a fire that is still burning inside me and hopefully will burn a few
more decades.

What was your book that changed everything?
