The Cologne [Ruby and Rails usergroup](http://www.rurug.de) will meet on
_Thursday, 24 March at 20:00_ at the [Coworking Cologne](http://www.coworkingcologne.de/). 

We will have a talk by Jan LÃ¼hr about JRuby and an open mike session
afterwards. If you want to talk to ruby developers, show your newest work or
just have a beer with some great people, you have to be there :) .
