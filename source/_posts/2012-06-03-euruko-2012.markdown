And [Euruko](http://www.euruko2012.org/) did it again. This was my [second time](http://bitboxer.de/2011/05/30/thanks-euruko-crew/)
at a Euruko conference and I am as impressed as I was last year in Berlin. The
organizers here in Amsterdam have done a great job to make the conference a
huge success. The [@tenderlove](http://twitter.com/tenderlove) friday hug
should also considered to be a Euruko organizers hug ;) .

Things I loved:

- The Tuschinksi Theater was one of the most insane conference locations. Just
  look at the
  [photos](http://www.dieselpunks.org/profiles/blogs/dieselpunk-movie-theater).
  Unbelievable.
- The party at the [roest](http://amsterdamroest.nl/) was a great closure for
  the event. Nice people, a fireplace and it was near my [airbnb apartment](http://de.airbnb.com/rooms/103527) ;) .
- The talks where great. My list of stuff to investigate is pretty long now.
  Hopefully I will have time to try everything on the next weekend.
- The people. The vibe was great. Okay, there where some haters, but sadly you
  can't have a conference of 600 people without them :( .
- The fruits they handed out as snacks. Good Idea to keep us nerds on a healthy
  diet. Athens, can you do that, too?
- The [bob ross theme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Ross) that
  [@roy](http://twitter.com/roy) added to the conference during his talk. (Btw:
  thanks again for the
  [sticker](https://twitter.com/bitboxer/status/208830209825325057), roy ;) )
- The iPhone/Android app with push notifications for updates during the
  conference
- The rfid checkin game

And if you missed it, you can get the vibe of the first day in [this video](https://vimeo.com/43281923).
There will be more videos and the talks uploaded soon.

I can't wait to be in Athens next year.

And Athens, one little thing: can you make the voting process for the euruko
2013 better? Create a site where every attendee can vote, or use handsigns. The
sound volume stuff is not good enough anymore.
