      <p>Till around two years ago I had tons of subscriptions in my RSS
reader. Hundreds of news I had to skim through every day. Then
I realized this was neither sustainable nor healthy. I needed to
spent less time on skimming through news that did not interest me.</p>

<p>I scrolled through all the sites that I had in my RSS reader and removed
2/3 of them. I didn’t need three tech sites talking about the same
stuff. Choosing just one would be enough. Week after week I reduced the
list of subscribed feeds.</p>

<p>After a few months of cutting through my subscriptions I realized something:
I replaced three feeds with a newsletter. That was an eye opener to me. Instead
of reading all the news, I trusted someone to create a curated list of news for
me. Why should I read all the stuff out there when I just could get the most
important news of the week? This freed lots of time that I could use for
other things.</p>

<p>Today my RSS reader has under 50 subscriptions, most of them only post something once a month. A handful of them are still news sites. Sites I really enjoy reading on a daily basis. The rest is done through those newsletters. Every Sunday morning I grab a hot chocolate and open the newsletter folder of my email app and start reading them. And after 30 minutes I am done and up to date again.</p>

<p>Another positive side effect: I’m not lured into reading some comments
discussing the links on reddit or hacker news. Most times reading those comments
is not worth it anyway :wink: .</p>

<p>Here is the list of newsletters I’m currently subscribed to:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://rubyweekly.com/">Ruby Weekly</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://html5weekly.com/">Html5 Weekly</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://javascriptweekly.com/">Javascript Weekly</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.hackernewsletter.com/">Hackernewsletter</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://changelog.com/weekly/">Changelog</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://iosdevweekly.com/">iOS Dev Weekly</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://neues-aus-der-zukunft.de">Neues aus der Zukunft</a></li>
</ul>

<p>What newsletters have you subscribed to? Did you found another solution to keep up to date?</p>

    <p>
      I am a freelance polyglot developer and love HTML5, testing, JavaScript, Ruby and Elixir. In the last 20 years I
      have been in lots of different roles, from Java to Elixir, from backend developer at a 3 people team in an early
      phase startup to the CTO of a web agency. Some of my work can be seen on my <a href="https://bodo.tasche.me/projects">projects page</a>.

    <p>
      Need help developing your MVP or to add new features into your current app? Need a CTO or a front/backend
      developer for hire? Send me an <a href="bodo@tasche.me">email</a>.
