      <p>I often see a pattern with on boarding new coworkers that I find really
problematic. The „push to production on the first day“ rule. Lots of people in
my twitter feed are constantly bragging that their new coworker was able to
push something to production on day one. The idea behind is that it gives the
new hire a great feeling of accomplishment on the first day. It should also
demonstrates how great the company is doing on the „release often“ scale.</p>

<p>I have huge problems with this. Just think how it feels to be the new person.
You don’t know that much about all the new people you are meeting. Have a hard
time to remember all those names. And on top of that someone is sitting next to
you expecting you to finish a small ticket together with them to push it to
production. For me this feels like having an important test the first day of
school. This is the opposite of what a first day should look like for me. It
should give the new person room to get a feeling how the company is structured,
meet all the new coworkers,  getting comfortable. Focus on the people, not the
code. The first day is already super stressful as it is. If you know that they
expect you to push to production on day one just adds more unwanted pressure.</p>

<p>For me an ideal first day is a nice introduction to the people you work with,
the tons of rules the new workplace has (How do I take vacations? What do I do
when I am sick?), and getting comfortable at your new workspace. The code
should never be the #1 priority. It’s more important that you leave the job
with a „I like those people I met“ feeling instead of a „I finished a small
artificial task today“. That is exactly what Wooga did when I started my new
job there a couple of months ago. They never expected me to be productive in
the first couple of days. Instead we talked a lot, I could look at how the
team is working on tickets, read lots of code to see how they work. And on day
3 I had a nice feature pushed to production. During the whole time I felt
valued and not pressured to do something „just because“.</p>

    <p>
      I am a freelance polyglot developer and love HTML5, testing, JavaScript, Ruby and Elixir. In the last 20 years I
      have been in lots of different roles, from Java to Elixir, from backend developer at a 3 people team in an early
      phase startup to the CTO of a web agency. Some of my work can be seen on my <a href="https://bodo.tasche.me/projects">projects page</a>.

      Need help developing your MVP or to add new features into your current app? Need a CTO or a front/backend
      developer for hire? Send me an <a href="bodo@tasche.me">email</a>.
