      <p>A lot of programmers think of programming as a
<a href="http://devblog.avdi.org/2014/02/10/the-passion-gospel/">craft</a>. Me included.
But there is a thing in other crafts that I miss in the programming world.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journeyman_years">Journeyman years</a>. If you aren’t aware of that concept, it basically means that
after you are finished with learning the basic skill of your craft, you had
to go on a journey for a few years to improve your skills with new techniques
and styles used in other cities or countries. Granted, there are not that
many who still do this and the rules behind most of those organizations are
very archaic. But the motivation behind that idea is something we should adapt.</p>

<p>For me it comes down to one basic rule: don’t stay in a company for more than
a few years. Learn as much as possible from your current company and give back
as much as you can. If you have the feeling that you stopped learning new
stuff or get bored, switch. And even if you like your job, you should consider
switching after a few years. Often you only realize that you were bored in your
job after you switched to another one.</p>

<p>Another reason to switch is something I call “incest of ideas”. It boils down
to the problem that a team of people that only has minimal contact to others,
tends to “invent” stuff that works around their current problem without seeing
the larger issue in their architecture. The only way to prevent this is
to get “fresh blood” into your team on a regular basis.</p>

<p>I know that freelancing is not for everyone. Me included. But do yourself a
favour. Think about when you learned something new the last time or had a day
without thinking that your coworkers suck. We are in a very unique situation.
You as a developer can choose your company.  There are companies lined up to
hire developers. It would be stupid not to use this to your advantage. And yes,
sometimes a new job is crappy. You got promised stuff and realized that they
lied to you. But that’s not a real problem. Switch again :wink: .</p>

<p>I started a new job three weeks ago and never learned as much as in those few
weeks. Trust me. It will be worth it. You only have this one life. You should
try to get the best out of it.</p>

    <p>
      I am a freelance polyglot developer and love HTML5, testing, JavaScript, Ruby and Elixir. In the last 20 years I
      have been in lots of different roles, from Java to Elixir, from backend developer at a 3 people team in an early
      phase startup to the CTO of a web agency. Some of my work can be seen on my <a href="https://bodo.tasche.me/projects">projects page</a>.

    <p>
      Need help developing your MVP or to add new features into your current app? Need a CTO or a front/backend
      developer for hire? Send me an <a href="bodo@tasche.me">email</a>.
