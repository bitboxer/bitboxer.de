      <p>Currently I see a very worrying trend in the startup scene. A trend that
circumvents everything workers fought for in Germany. We finally will get a
minimum wage law in Germany on 1st of January 2015. But it looks like lots of
startups don’t like that.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The proposed federal minimum wage of €8.50 per hour – which would also apply
to interns, known in German as Praktikanten – would have fatal consequences
for the startup scene. In nearly every startup, these Praktikanten are
working for less money or are waiving part of a full salary, and mostly for
longer periods than the proposed minimum wage exemption of six weeks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a quote from <a href="http://news.siliconallee.com/2014/06/20/guest-column-minimum-wage-plans-would-be-fatal-for-germanys-startup-scene/">Christoph Gerlinger of the German Startups Group</a>.</p>

<p>And for me this is pretty disgusting. Basically he says that his business
model is build on top of people that work for nearly nothing.</p>

<p>And it gets even worse. Why should you hire workers in the first place? Just
create a platform where you are an intermediary between the customer and your
workforce. Like Uber Pop, Helpling or others are doing right now.</p>

<p>This removes all sorts of problems:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Minimum wage laws? Don’t care. Those workers just have to take what we give
them. Which translates to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/some-uber-drivers-say-companys-promise-of-big-pay-day-doesnt-match-reality/2014/09/06/17f5d82c-224a-11e4-958c-268a320a60ce_story.html?Post%20generic=%3Ftid%3Dsm_twitter_washingtonpost">$3 per hour with Uber</a>.</li>
  <li>Social insurance contribution, health insurance? Those workers have to deal with those pesky
things. Why do we need to deal with that? It’s their health, not ours.</li>
  <li>Payed vacation? What? Don’t know that word.</li>
  <li>Customers that have problems? Let them rate the worker and remove those
with a rating <a href="http://priceonomics.com/are-one-star-reviews-for-assholes/">worse that 4.6 out of 5</a>
from the system. Job protection? Bwahahaha. Nope.</li>
  <li>Insurances for car accidents and other stuff? Oh, sure. The workers will deal
with all of that. For sure. Pinky promise.</li>
</ul>

<p>And the best of it all: you only pay your workers if they actually work. You don’t need
to have workers “in stock” for peak demands.</p>

<p>I don’t want this to be our future. The workers in Europe fought hard for
their rights. I want that startups take responsibilities for their workforce.
I want them to treat them as humans. As someone who earns respect. And out
of respect for your workforce you should pay them a decent wage and give
them all the things a worker can expect from a company.</p>

<p>The buzzword for this kind of startups is “the new sharing economy”. And sharing
should also mean that you share your profits. And take responsibility.</p>

<p>Let’s build a “caring economy” instead.</p>

      I am a freelance polyglot developer and love HTML5, testing, JavaScript, Ruby and Elixir. In the last 20 years I
      have been in lots of different roles, from Java to Elixir, from backend developer at a 3 people team in an early
      phase startup to the CTO of a web agency. Some of my work can be seen on my <a href="https://bodo.tasche.me/projects">projects page</a>.

      Need help developing your MVP or to add new features into your current app? Need a CTO or a front/backend
      developer for hire? Send me an <a href="bodo@tasche.me">email</a>.
