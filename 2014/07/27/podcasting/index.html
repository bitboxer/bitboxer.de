    <div class="post">
      <p>Before I moved to Berlin I was part of the <a href="http://nerdkun.de">Nerdkunde
podcast</a>. Sadly it was not possible to be part of the
podcast without being in Cologne. But since last month I am part of another
awesome podcast called <a href="http://bitsofberlin.org">bits of berlin</a>.  Go there and
listen to the episodes if you haven’t.</p>

<p>In Cologne I never had to deal with the equipment. <a href="https://twitter.com/kgzme">Klaus</a> and
the <a href="http://home-office-cologne.de/">home-office</a> took care of that. For the new
podcast I needed my own hardware. So I had to investigate what would be the
best suited for me.</p>

<h1 id="hardware">Hardware</h1>

<p>The hardware is the expensive part of recording a podcast. If you aim for good
audio quality, you need to invest a little bit of money.</p>

<h2 id="audio-interface">Audio Interface</h2>

<p>You can’t attach more than one microphone to a normal computer. You need an
external audio interface for this. For example the <a href="http://www.thomann.de/de/presonus_audiobox_44vsl.htm">Presonus AudioBox 44VSL</a>
or the <a href="http://www.thomann.de/de/steinberg_ur44.htm">Steinberg UR44</a>. Both
devices are capable of recording 4 people. If you plan to record more people,
you need the bigger versions of those. Both do not offer a 4 channel output, so
you need to buy a 1:4 headphone amp like <a href="http://www.thomann.de/de/behringer_ha400.htm">this one</a>.</p>

<h2 id="headphones-and-microphones">Headphones and Microphones</h2>

<p>Most people will advise you to get a Headphone/Microphone combination. You can
move freely with them and don’t have to fear that the quality of the recording
will suffer because of it. If you have the money, you should get the
<a href="http://www.thomann.de/de/beyerdynamic_dt297pv80_mk_ii.htm">Beyerdynamic DT 297</a>.  Those are the
best you can get. I understand that you maybe don’t want to invest into
something that expensive if you start to do podcasting. If you want to
go the cheap route, you should buy the <a href="https://www.thomann.de/de/the_tbone_hc_95.htm">t.bone HC 95</a>.
They are cheap, but they will do the job.</p>

<p>Hint: search on eBay for used equipment. Sometimes you will find Beyerdynamic Headphones.</p>

<h1 id="software">Software</h1>

<p>Luckily the software side of podcast recording is not that expensive.
If you are able to speak German you have to try the
<a href="http://ultraschall.wikigeeks.de">Ultraschall</a> add-on for <a href="http://reaper.fm">Reaper</a>. There
is nothing like it. Reaper only costs 60$ and Ultraschall is free.  With that
combination you have the best recording and cutting software with all the
features you need. Go through the extensive list of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrHlJxVCzpcUF8e0pbt60uSK26JNxbFzG">YouTube videos</a> by the
Ultraschall Team and you should be ready for your first podcast :wink: .</p>

<h1 id="processing-and-releasing">Processing and releasing</h1>

<p>After you recorded and cut your podcast, you need to do the post processing. Removing background
noise, adjust the volume and much more. This is very time consuming and not that easy for
a beginner. Luckily you don’t have to do it yourself. Just upload your track to <a href="http://auphonic.com">Auphonic</a>
and let them deal with it.</p>

<p>To release your podcast you have four options:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Wordpress with the <a href="http://podlove.org/podlove-podcast-publisher/">podlove podcast publisher</a>
</li>
  <li>Simple blog (like Jekyll) and use <a href="http://help.soundcloud.com/customer/portal/articles/1209292-can-i-podcast-with-soundcloud-">Soundcloud</a> for hosting</li>
  <li>Use a hoster that is specialized in podcasting, for example <a href="https://www.podigee.com">podigee</a>
</li>
  <li>Do everything on your own and create the RSS feed with your own program.</li>
</ul>

<p>After that you need to register your podcast in <a href="https://www.apple.com/itunes/podcasts/specs.html">iTunes</a>. Most
of the podcast clients use the iTunes database as source for their libraries.</p>

<p>Now you should be ready for your first podcast. But do the world a favour: we don’t need another
Apple news podcast. There are tons out there already. Find another niche.</p>

      I am a freelance polyglot developer and love HTML5, testing, JavaScript, Ruby and Elixir. In the last 20 years I
      have been in lots of different roles, from Java to Elixir, from backend developer at a 3 people team in an early
      phase startup to the CTO of a web agency. Some of my work can be seen on my <a href="https://bodo.tasche.me/projects">projects page</a>.
