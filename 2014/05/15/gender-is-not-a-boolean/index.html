    <div class="post">
      <p>Choose your favorite color:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Eggshell</li>
  <li>Yellow with green dots</li>
</ul>

<p>This sounds silly, doesn’t it? Where is my color? Why only those two? And if
you only give those two possible answers in a form to choose from in a web app,
some people will get really mad and would try to create an internet shitstorm
to get that changed.  “Please add at least <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosso_corsa">Rosso corsa</a>!!  That’s the best color!! #colorgate”</p>

<p>But when it comes to gender, for most people it is totally okay to just ask:
male or female. If you search for gender on StackOverflow, you will see lots of
questions how to store it in the database. And sadly most answers only think of
male and female. Two settings. Sounds legit for a boolean.  Male = true and
female = false. Done.</p>

<p>That is so wrong on so many levels, it’s not even funny.</p>

<p>There are lots of people out there that can’t or don’t want to specify their
gender to either of those sides. Why should they? Why should we force that
on them? Some people love yellow with green dots. There is nothing wrong
with that. There is so much more than just black and white when it comes
to most things. Gender is not a boolean.</p>

<p>Sadly there many idiots out there without a proper understanding of the
topic. When I tweeted this last week:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Small reminder: gender is not a boolean field. Leave room in your form for everyone!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>there were lots of bad reactions. This for example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>it is only important if you can get an advantage from either one. Sometimes
it is just about pure attention.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Luckily <a href="https://twitter.com/oliklee">Oliver Klee</a> answered this to that person:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s about defining one’s own indentity and about being recognized in that
identity, not about attention.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s actually quite simple: A person’s rights or pay should not depend on
their gender. And gender is more than just m/w.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let’s stop this. Right now. Create a welcoming app. Starting at the sign up form.</p>

<p>For the <a href="http://euru.camp">eurucamp</a> Call for Proposal app, we choosed to have a select box
with the following entries:</p>

<ul>
  <li>(leave empty)</li>
  <li>Male</li>
  <li>Female</li>
  <li>I don’t identify with any of the other options</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s as simple as that. Or you could go a step further: let the users specify what
they want to be called.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Don’t want to say</li>
  <li>Male</li>
  <li>Female</li>
  <li>
    <hr>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This should cost you 5 minutes more when creating that form. But it will be
worth it. Thanks!</p>

<p>Btw: <a href="http://bitcrowd.net">bitcrowd</a> has gender neutral restrooms and is hiring.</p>

    <p>
      I am a freelance polyglot developer and love HTML5, testing, JavaScript, Ruby and Elixir. In the last 20 years I
      have been in lots of different roles, from Java to Elixir, from backend developer at a 3 people team in an early
      phase startup to the CTO of a web agency. Some of my work can be seen on my <a href="https://bodo.tasche.me/projects">projects page</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Need help developing your MVP or to add new features into your current app? Need a CTO or a front/backend
      developer for hire? Send me an <a href="bodo@tasche.me">email</a>.
