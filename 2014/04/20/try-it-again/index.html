      <p>If you know me for a long time, you probably have heard this sentence from me
at least once: “I will try that again in a few months”. It’s one of the most
important things for me to keep up with technology.</p>

<p>I stumble upon new software and development concepts on a weekly basis. But
sometimes it’s not ready for prime time. An early alpha with tons of bugs is
not the same as the final product. To judge a product just on that is a
little bit unfair. Or I don’t have use for a concept right now, but I think it
could be interesting for me later on.</p>

<p>Most people would try an alpha, see it’s buggy and forget the software. But it
doesn’t need to be that way. If you find something interesting, simply remind
yourself a little bit later. Maybe the software got usable after six months. Or you
finally found a usage for a concept.</p>

<p>Right now I have three piles for stuff I found interesting:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Pile 1</strong>: Needs to be investigated when I have more time. For example on a nice Sunday
morning with a hot chocolate.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Pile 2</strong>: Not 100% ready yet. Check it again in 3 months</li>
  <li>
<strong>Pile 3</strong>: Sounds promising, but needs more time. Check back in 6 months</li>
</ul>

<p>These rules are not set in stone. Sometimes I put something in one pile
and move it to another one a few weeks later. Just make sure that you scroll
through those lists on a regular basis. Currently I am using <a href="https://trello.com/bitboxer/recommend">Trello</a>
to keep track of these three piles. And it’s perfect for that stuff.</p>

<p>And yes, sometimes a promising software doesn’t deliver after six more months.
Or you loose interest in a topic after a few months. But that doesn’t matter.
What matters is that you gave it a second try. Or a third one.</p>

<p>The first time <a href="https://www.docker.io/">Docker</a> scrolled through my time line,
it was way to early to use it. The infrastructure around it was not mature
enough.  But now it’s one of the hottest things on the block. I kept looking at
it’s progress on a monthly basis because of my list.</p>

<p>Another example is <a href="http://neovim.org">NeoVim</a>. Right now they have lots of
refactoring ahead of them. It will need some time to get a usable thing out of
it, but I will keep on looking into it because it’s in one of my piles.</p>

    <p>
      I am a freelance polyglot developer and love HTML5, testing, JavaScript, Ruby and Elixir. In the last 20 years I
      have been in lots of different roles, from Java to Elixir, from backend developer at a 3 people team in an early
      phase startup to the CTO of a web agency. Some of my work can be seen on my <a href="https://bodo.tasche.me/projects">projects page</a>.

      Need help developing your MVP or to add new features into your current app? Need a CTO or a front/backend
      developer for hire? Send me an <a href="bodo@tasche.me">email</a>.
