    <div class="post">
      <p>The last weekend was the final chapter of what took over 8 months to prepare:
the <a href="http://euru.camp">eurucamp 2014</a>. I was part of the conference organization and
tried to help wherever I could. My role was relatively small. I was part of
the ticket team and tried to help here and there. During the eurucamp I was
part of the <a href="http://2014.eurucamp.org/podcast">podcast</a> team. Sadly that ment 
that I could not listen to the talks, but instead I could be part of the 
interviews with the speakers. That’s a deal I could live with :wink: .</p>

<p>During the preparation of the conference I always had a list in my head. A list
I <a href="http://bitboxer.de/2012/08/20/eurucamp-2012/">wrote in 2012</a>. During every
meeting, every Skype chat I tried to think of it. Tried to fix the issues I had
back then. But luckily that was not needed. Everyone knew what we needed to do.
What we needed to take care of.</p>

<p>For example the food issue at the Hotel Müggelsee. We found an awesome partner
in <a href="http://knofi.de/">Knofi</a> for the food during the lunch breaks and got rewarded
by tweets like this:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">
<p>Haven't eaten that much delicious &amp; healthy food at a conference since... Ah yeah ;) Great job <a href="https://twitter.com/eurucamp">@eurucamp</a>. You guys didn't disappoint! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ec14?src=hash">#ec14</a></p>— Moritz Heiber (@moritzheiber) <a href="https://twitter.com/moritzheiber/statuses/495614640211361792">August 2, 2014</a>
</blockquote>

<p>Sadly there was one little issue. The vegan boxes had an egg product in them. But to
quote Florian: “at least it was not fish” :wink: . This will be important to double
check in the next year.</p>

<p>Some things worked out in the last minute, but overall I would say that I was
amazed how much such a small team could do. The vibe on the conference was
incredible. Everyone was smiling and happy just to be there. The twitter stream
was filled with tweets about how awesome the conference was. I got goosebumps
sitting on the lawn in front of the outdoor stage. Seeing everyone enjoying the
weather and the conference was a great feeling.</p>

<p>A few people got little cuts in their feet while trying to swim near the venue. This was
the one thing I did not take care of from the list. Bummer. But I have now idea how
we could improve on that in the next year :sob: .</p>

<p>There are two things I want to highlight that have been very important for me:
<a href="http://blog.eurucamp.org/2014/05/21/eurucamp-cfp-recap">the anonymous CfP</a> and the
<a href="http://blog.eurucamp.org/2014/07/27/eurucamp-2014-will-have-real-time-captioning">real time captioning</a>.</p>

<p>If you organize a conference and don’t do an anonymous CfP, you should think again.
That process lead to the awesome talks we had. From lots of people who would never
had a chance otherwise. Don’t just invite famous speakers.</p>

<p>Seeing the real time captioning was great, too. At first most people think that this
only helps people that are hearing impaired, but this is totally wrong. Tons of
people thanked us for this because they had problems following the accents or needed
to jump a few sentences back to get what the speaker was trying to say. The captioning
was a great help for everyone. Thanks to <a href="http://asquera.de">asquera</a> for this!</p>

<p>If you haven’t watched it yet, here is a nice recap video by <a href="http://twitter.com/polarblau">polarblau</a>:</p>

      I am a freelance polyglot developer and love HTML5, testing, JavaScript, Ruby and Elixir. In the last 20 years I
      have been in lots of different roles, from Java to Elixir, from backend developer at a 3 people team in an early
      phase startup to the CTO of a web agency. Some of my work can be seen on my <a href="https://bodo.tasche.me/projects">projects page</a>.
