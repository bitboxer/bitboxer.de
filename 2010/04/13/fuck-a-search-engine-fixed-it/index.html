      <p>I love to test new web search engines. Every few months I try to use a new one
for a few hours.  Mostly just to check if finally someone made something that
creates results that are equal or better than Google’s. Yes, I hate the Google
monopoly and I use Gmail, Google Calendar and fucking every other service they
offer (except for Buzz…that one sucks monkey balls :smile: ). BUT I only use
those because they are the best services, not because I love Google that much.</p>

<p>The first query I do is always my name. I know all pages I have written on and
this is a nice hint on how the sites are rated on that engine. After that I
search for a few things that are hard to find or stuff like “ruby” that could
mean a lot of different things. One of the queries that no search engine could
answer is the search for my brothers name. Yes, some people search engines
could find him, but I don’t use those kind of search engines.</p>

<p>Today something strange happend. I entered his name into 
“<a href="http://duckduckgo.com">Duck duck go</a>” and the first page was filled with
links about him.  His name could be translated to “Oliver Bag” and if you
search for “Oliver Tasche” on Google, you will find tons of pages filled with
stores that sell “s.Oliver Bags”.  Not on Duck Duck go. They found him. Just
compare the results for yourself <a href="http://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=oliver+tasche">on Google</a>
or on <a href="http://duckduckgo.com/?q=oliver+tasche">Duck Duck go</a>.</p>

<p>Maybe I just found my new search engine :smile: .</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I had a small issue and asked them about it and got an answer from
<a href="http://www.gabrielweinberg.com/">the founder</a> of Duck Duck go himself within a
few minutes. How awesome is that?!</p>

<p>My issue was very simple: the default region was set to USA. If you want to get
localized to your region, you can change that in the
<a href="http://duckduckgo.com/settings.html">settings</a>.</p>

    <p>
      I am a freelance polyglot developer and love HTML5, testing, JavaScript, Ruby and Elixir. In the last 20 years I
      have been in lots of different roles, from Java to Elixir, from backend developer at a 3 people team in an early
      phase startup to the CTO of a web agency. Some of my work can be seen on my <a href="https://bodo.tasche.me/projects">projects page</a>.

      Need help developing your MVP or to add new features into your current app? Need a CTO or a front/backend
      developer for hire? Send me an <a href="bodo@tasche.me">email</a>.
