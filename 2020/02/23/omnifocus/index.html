    <div class="post">
      <p>In the last <a href="/2020/01/30/how-i-organize-myself/">post</a> I promised that I will explain how I use <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus">OmniFocus</a>. Hopefully you get some interesting new ideas after reading this.</p>

<p>The most important thing for me: if I want to remember something as a to do, I will put it into OmniFocus. No matter what it is. To make things easier I have several projects to sort them into.</p>

<p>Most of the time I just quickly add it and sort it later using the Inbox of OmniFocus. Every other day I will open the inbox and check the things in there. Sometimes it is not needed anymore and I delete it but most of the time I sort it into the correct projects/tags and assign due and defer dates to it.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs start with the projects I have.</p>

<h1 id="projects">Projects</h1>

<p>I create a project for everything that has more than 2 to dos attached to it. Yes, that means I have a lot of projects, but it makes filtering for things way easier if you store it correctly.</p>

<p>Additionally, I have projects that are containers for more general things like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Things I lent to other people (books, money, ‚Ä¶)</li>
  <li>Things I have preordered and wait for them to be shipped (Kickstarter and other similar platforms)</li>
  <li>Packaging lists for vacations, festivals and other occasions. I use them as a template and create new ones based on them for specific vacations. That way I won‚Äôt forget important things. If I do, I put them into the master list to remember them the next time.</li>
  <li>Reoccurring to dos. I have a separate list for to dos that I have to do regularly. Swapping filters, tires, cleaning items that only need cleaning twice a year</li>
  <li>Birthdays. This is a really nice one. I have a project for buying presents. Those to dos are scheduled once a year two weeks before the actual birthday. That way I will never forget to buy something. Saved me a lot of headaches already ü§£.</li>
  <li>My project to try out things again later. More details about that <a href="/2014/04/20/try-it-again/">here</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="tags">Tags</h1>

<p>I don‚Äôt have tons of tags. I am trying to limit them to just the minimum that I need. Somehow I cannot work with too many at the same time.</p>

<ul>
  <li>People. I have tags for people to signal me that either that person has to do something or I have to do something for her/him.</li>
  <li>Some places like the hardware store. OmniFocus notifies me if I am close to it and that makes me remember to buy certain things there.</li>
  <li>Next. This tag is for things that are important and need to be done soonish.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="defer--due">Defer / Due</h1>

<p>Lots of my items have defer dates attached to them. That signals me that these are not important for now and I delay the action on them days or weeks into the future. Future me has to deal with them.</p>

<p>Due dates are only assigned to items that really have a due date (see <a href="https://learnomnifocus.com/tutorials/best-practice-due-dates/">here</a> why). I will not add fake dates to make things important. I am using the next tag for that.</p>

<h1 id="views">Views</h1>

<p>For a long time I thought I don‚Äôt need custom views. After reading how a couple of people are using them, for example <a href="http://uncorrected.net/using-omnifocus-to-shape-your-day/">here</a>, I realized that custom views are the last missing piece to make OmniFocus really great for me.</p>

<p>This is the view I am using 90% of the time I am in OmniFocus:</p>

<p><img src="/images/2020-02-23-omnifocus/views.png" alt="My OmniFocus today view"></p>

<p>It is called my ‚Äútoday‚Äù view and shows everything that is due soon, flagged or has the tag ‚Äúnext‚Äù attached to it. This will filter out all items I don‚Äôt need today. I only see what is important for the day.</p>

<p>And this concludes how I use OmniFocus. If you have other suggestions, feel free to ping me! I always love to improve my workflow.</p>

      I am a freelance polyglot developer and love HTML5, testing, JavaScript, Ruby and Elixir. In the last 20 years I
      have been in lots of different roles, from Java to Elixir, from backend developer at a 3 people team in an early
      phase startup to the CTO of a web agency. Some of my work can be seen on my <a href="https://bodo.tasche.me/projects">projects page</a>.
