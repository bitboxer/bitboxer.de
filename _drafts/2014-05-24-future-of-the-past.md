The future. It's here. Everyone has the whole knowledge of humankind in
his pocket. We can generate energy by farming the sun and wind. We have
the first prototypes of self driving cars. Commercial spaceflight is
starting to become a big industry. Lots of the stuff that had been
science fiction back in the beginning of the last century are now
science fact.

Sadly most of the dystopian visions became true as well. The USA is
capturing the communication of complete countries. Every phone call
every sms, every email. Everything. Before Snowden everyone who said this
was considered a tin foil hat wearing nutjob.

What is even more shocking about this is how the majority of people reacted
when they learned about this: "yeah, whatever. I don't have anything to hide".
But if you read the dystopian books, this should not be a shock at all.
Most stories work this way: little group of rebels fights dystopian regime.
Sometimes they win. Sometimes they don't. But most of the time the public
in those stories didn't care about the dystopian nature of the country
they lived in.

What about painting a positive picture about humankind.

And with this 

Dystopia is here, let's fix it. Invision a brighter future
