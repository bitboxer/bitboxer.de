It's time again for my list of talks that I loved on the chaos communication
congress. Sadly I wasn't able to be there this year. Hopefully I will be back
at 35c3. [Someone](https://www.instagram.com/p/BcSrf1LDz_3/?taken-by=langziehohr) kept
me rather busy :wink: .

And now to the talks I saw on my couch in the few moments of free time I had.
