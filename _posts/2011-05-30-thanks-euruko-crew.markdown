Wow. The [Eurko 2011](http://euruko2011.org) was one of the best conferences I
ever attended. Tons of great talks and super friendly attendees. Sadly we had
to travel back to cologne and couldn't go to the [github meetup](https://github.com/blog/860-github-drinkup-berlin-may-29th)
on sunday :( . The next time I will plan with more time afterwards. 

If you have missed my talk, you can find the slides here:

If you haven't done yet, please rate my talk
[here](http://speakerrate.com/talks/7676-endless-fun-with-arduino-and-eventmachine)
and leave a few hints on how to improve it.

See you in [Amsterdam](http://lasteuruko.org/)!
