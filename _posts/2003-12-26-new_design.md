Again a new Design. Now it's possible for me to add tons of new Projects into
the Site without too much trouble. The new Look should be much cleaner than the
old one. Hope you all like it.

[TV Browser](http://tvbrowser.sf.net) will release a new Version in the next
few days. It will include two Plugins from me. A Google and a IMDB-Search Tool.
At the  moment I am writing a Tool to add User-Ratings into
[TVBrowser](http://tvbrowser.sf.net). I will launch a new WebSite for it
[when it's done<sup>TM</sup>](http://www.3drealms.com/duke4/).
