If you write RubyOnRails code on your mac, you definitely have to use
[Textmate](http://macromates.com/) for it. Yeah, I know. Pay for a simple text
editor? Just try the 30 day trial version and you will see it's worth it.

**Railscast theme**

The theme I am using at the moment is the Railscast Theme by Ryan Bates. You
can find it in the about section of his
[Railscasts](http://railscasts.com/about). Dark background and nice font
colors. When you look at the code the whole day, it should look good :) . Don't
forget to download the [Bitstream Vera Font](http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/ttf-bitstream-vera/1.10/).

**Ackmate**

[Ack](http://betterthangrep.com/) is one of the greatest scripts I know. Grep
for coders. Fast, easy to use and very good defaults when searching for code
snipplets.

If you want to use it within Textmate, you should try
[AckMate](http://github.com/protocool/AckMate).

**ProjectPlus**

Need better project support including features like git? Use
[ProjectPlus](http://ciaranwal.sh/projectplus).

**Github Bundle**

Speaking about git. What about github? Yes, there's a bundle for that :) .
[DrNic's github bundle](http://github.com/drnic/github-tmbundle). 

**Ruby On Rails Bundle**

Dr Nic's most important Textmate bundle is the [Ruby on Rails Bundle](http://github.com/drnic/ruby-on-rails-tmbundle).
With it you can easily navigate between controllers, models and other files.
Besides that it adds tons of shortcuts. Whatever you will need for RoR
development, you will find it in there.

If you want to keep track of all chrome extensions I use, you can subscribe to
my[ links on Delicious tagged as Textmate](http://delicious.com/bodum/textmate).
