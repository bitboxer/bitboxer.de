It is now a tradition for me to spent the last days of the year with fellow
nerds on the chaos communication congress in Hamburg.  And as [last
year](/2015/01/04/31-31c3-retrospective/) I spent lots of time in the
[RubyTown](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2015/wiki/Assembly:Rubytown) assembly
and wandering around talking to people.

If you have never been there, try to go this year! It is totally worth it.

But the good news is: as always nearly all talks [are online](https://media.ccc.de/c/32c3).

Here is a list of talks I loved:

# Beyond your cable modem

How not to configure your network if you are an internet provider.

# The Perl Jam 2

Last year Netanel Rubin presented [a talk](https://media.ccc.de/v/31c3_-_6243_-_en_-_saal_1_-_201412292200_-_the_perl_jam_exploiting_a_20_year-old_vulnerability_-_netanel_rubin)
in which he ranted about problems in the Perl language and how
people are using Perl. This is a follow up.

Be warned. He is really ranting a lot. If you have problems with
that, stay away from this talk.

# Unpatchable
