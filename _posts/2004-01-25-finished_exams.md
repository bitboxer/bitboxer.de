I finished my Exams on Friday. Now I can work full-time. My Title now is:
"Fachinformatiker-Anwendungsentwicklung", wich means that I am officialy a
coder now ...

I update [JCalendar](http://sourceforge.net/projects/jcalendar) a little bit. A
few guys have send me some language Files and a Bugfix. Thanks to you !!
