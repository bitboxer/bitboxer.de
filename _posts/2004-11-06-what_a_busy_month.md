This month was very interesting. I helped a lot of Open-Source Projects.

The Developer of [Jacob](http://sf.net/projects/jacob-project) needed some help
to move his Stuff to SourceForge. Jacob is a Java-Com Bridge. I helped creating
the CVS and the Wiki for his Site. Jacob is used by me for the Pinnacle-Driver
for the [CapturePlugin](http://wiki.tvbrowser.org/index.php/CapturePlugin) of
[TV-Browser](http://www.tvbrowser.org)

At my company ( [LexisNexis](http://www.lexisnexis.de) ) we sponsored some
development for [Majix](http://sf.net/projects/majix). Majix is a RTF to XML
converter written in Java. We needed some enhancements in the Table-Routines.

The rest of the Month I enhanced the Filter-System for
[TV-Browser](http://www.tvbrowser.org).  There are some very nice enhancements
in the [CVS](http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=79472) :wink: . Hope 1.1 is not
too far away now :smile: .
