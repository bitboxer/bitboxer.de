Till around two years ago I had tons of subscriptions in my RSS
reader. Hundreds of news I had to skim through every day. Then
I realized this was neither sustainable nor healthy. I needed to
spent less time on skimming through news that did not interest me.

I scrolled through all the sites that I had in my RSS reader and removed
2/3 of them. I didn't need three tech sites talking about the same
stuff. Choosing just one would be enough. Week after week I reduced the
list of subscribed feeds.

After a few months of cutting through my subscriptions I realized something:
I replaced three feeds with a newsletter. That was an eye opener to me. Instead
of reading all the news, I trusted someone to create a curated list of news for
me. Why should I read all the stuff out there when I just could get the most
important news of the week? This freed lots of time that I could use for
other things.

Today my RSS reader has under 50 subscriptions, most of them only post something once a month. A handful of them are still news sites. Sites I really enjoy reading on a daily basis. The rest is done through those newsletters. Every Sunday morning I grab a hot chocolate and open the newsletter folder of my email app and start reading them. And after 30 minutes I am done and up to date again.

Another positive side effect: I'm not lured into reading some comments
discussing the links on reddit or hacker news. Most times reading those comments
is not worth it anyway :wink: .

Here is the list of newsletters I'm currently subscribed to:

* [Ruby Weekly](http://rubyweekly.com/)
* [Html5 Weekly](http://html5weekly.com/)
* [Javascript Weekly](http://javascriptweekly.com/)
* [Hakernewsleter](http://www.hackernewsletter.com/)
* [Changelog](https://changelog.com/weekly/)
* [iOS Dev Weekly](https://iosdevweekly.com/)
* [Neues aus der Zukunft](https://neues-aus-der-zukunft.de)

What newsletters have you subscribed to? Did you found another solution to keep up to date?
