There comes a time when you need to add an API to your little Startup. Either to
let your iOS or Android app communicate with your page and/or to please your users.
Luckily it's very easy in Rails to create a nice API with a beautifull documentation
like this:

![Swagger UI](/images/2014-02-09-grape/grape.png)

On that screenshot you are seeing [Swagger](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-ui). A little
collection of HTML and Javscript to create a beautifull API documentation. If you combine that
with [Grape](https://github.com/intridea/grape), a micro framework for REST-like APIS,
you can start writing your API within minutes.

The first step for this is to add the following gems to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'grape', '~> 0.6.1'
gem 'grape-entity', '~> 0.4.0'
gem 'rack-contrib', '~> 1.1.0'
gem 'grape-swagger', '~> 0.7.2'
gem 'grape-swagger-rails',  '~> 0.0.8'
```

The `grape` and the `grape-entity` gem are the API DSL, the `rack-contrib` is used to be able to
use [JSONP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP) callbacks, the `grape-swagger` creates the
Swagger description file and the `grape-swagger-rails` embeds Swagger into your app.

Now you need to configure where the Swagger UI can find your API description file. For this add
the file `config/initializers/grape_swagger_rails.rb` and add this to it:

```ruby
GrapeSwaggerRails.options.url      = "/api/swagger_doc.json"
GrapeSwaggerRails.options.app_name = 'Example'
GrapeSwaggerRails.options.app_url  = '/'
```

Now you need to wire your API into the routes of your app. Add the following Files to the
`routes.rb` of your Rails project:

```ruby
# API+API Documentation
mount API::Base => '/api'
mount GrapeSwaggerRails::Engine => '/apidoc'
```

This adds the API into `/api` and the documentation to `/apidoc`.

The only thing missing now is the actual API. For example something
like this:

```ruby
module API
  class Base < Grape::API
    default_format :json

    # Separate the api into smaller
    # modules like this
    mount API::HighScores => '/high_scores'

    # Adds the swagger documentation to your
    # api. You only need this once, not in
    # every sub module
    add_swagger_documentation(
      base_path: "/api",
      hide_documentation_path: true
    )
  end
end
```

I created a little [example](https://github.com/bitboxer/grape_swagger_example)
project as a starting point for your experiments with this setup.

[Grape](https://github.com/intridea/grape) is a very powerful API framework and should
have everything you need from an API. There are tons of plugins for caching,
[Hypermedia](http://steveklabnik.github.io/hypermedia-presentation/) style APIs and much
more. The very extensive documentation is a good start to get into it.

If you need to tweak the Swagger UI you should read the documentation of
[Grape-Swagger-Rails](https://github.com/BrandyMint/grape-swagger-rails) and
[Grape-Swagger](https://github.com/tim-vandecasteele/grape-swagger).
