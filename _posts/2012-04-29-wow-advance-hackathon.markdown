Wow, THAT was a great weekend. The [Advance
Hackathon](http://hackathon.advance-conference.com/) was a complete success.
Over 100 people hacking, networking and having fun together. It was one of the
best hackathons I ever participated. The project topics have been very amazing.
From an instagram clone with a distributed storage system to a [lego sequenzer](http://www.twitvid.com/Q4UJM)
everyone worked on brilliant stuff.  During the whole time you could feel the
energy in the room. All projects can be found in the
[wiki](https://github.com/AdvanceHackathon/Hackathon/wiki/Projektvorschlaege-ADVANCE-HACKATHON).
Hopefully there will be an update about all projects on the
[blog](http://hackathon.advance-conference.com/de/news) soon. The great [german sign language presentation](https://twitter.com/#!/thetaesch/status/196253144391491584)
by [Pamela Perniss](http://www.pernipa.eu/) was a nice surpise, too!

And the food was fucking brilliant. I don't want to know how much weight I have
gained through that weekend :o . And the barista(!!) made perfect coffee:
