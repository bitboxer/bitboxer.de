[![](/images/2012-02-05-design-for-hackers-reverse-engineering-beauty/412sgxtpoml1.jpeg)](http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/1119998956/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=wannawork-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1638&creative=19454&creativeASIN=1119998956) 

My last book review was nearly [a year ago](http://bitboxer.de/2011/03/23/javascript-the-good-parts/). 
It's time to change that.

In the last few months I struggled a little bit with designing a few websites.
Yes, I am a web developer. And yes, I create good designed web pages. But
usually I get a Photoshop File and build the site from that. That needed to
change. 

My weapon of choice was [Design for Hackers: Reverse Engineering Beauty](http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/1119998956/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=wannawork-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1638&creative=19454&creativeASIN=1119998956)
by [David Kadavy](http://www.kadavy.net/). And it is really great. From layout
over fonts to color you will find everything covered in this book you need to
design a webpage. After this you have all the basic knowledge about design. The
next step is experimentation and learning from good looking sites.

Sadly the next book is only available in German, but "[Kunst. Die ganze Geschichte](http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/3832193855/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=wannawork-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1638&creative=19454&creativeASIN=3832193855)"
is a good companion for the design book. It covers the complete history of art
and explains the different styles and why the artist has painted the image how
he has painted it. You can get a great deal of inspiration from this. And to
every cologne citizen: you can get into the museums for free on every 1st
thursday. Use that!
