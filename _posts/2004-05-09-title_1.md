I haven't updated this Site for over a Month now, so I think it's time to tell
you what I have done in that time.

I added a HierarchyListener to JCalendar (Thanks to Petr Michalek) and a few
other things. If you want to play with it, it's in the
[CVS](http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=106414). I will release a new
Version when I fix that nasty Focus-Stuff (any help is welcome :D )...

The next (and best thing) was my work for a Project called
[TVBrowser](http://tvbrowser.sf.net). It's a great EPG written in Java. I have
done lot of stuff for it. One thing is a Plugin to rate TV Programs called
[TVAddicted](http://tvaddicted.wannawork.de/). Another thing was to add a new
Channel ([xxp](http://www.xxp.tv)) to the TVBrowser, more Channels will
follow...

That's it for now...
