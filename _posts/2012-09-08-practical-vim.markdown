I have switched to vim over a year ago. And I am pretty happy with that switch.
With all the tools vim is offering me, I am now typing faster and use less
keystrokes to get my things done. The only problem when switching to vim is to
learn the vim way. It is not that easy for a beginner to get a hang on that
different modes vim is presenting you. Basically there are two approaches on
how to learn vim. Both have one thing in common: if you don't use it, you don't
learn it ;) . Besides that it's a philosophical question what way is better. It
depends on you what way works best for you.

**Bottom up**

Use a basic vim with no modification, or with as less modification as possible.
No Rails plugin, no special syntax highlighting sauce. If you feel comfortable
enough in vim, you add one plugin at a time. Most people start with the plugins
that Tim Pope is offering on [his github account](github.com/tpope/). The
benefit of this is that you focus on the basic vim commands and don't get
distracted by the stuff that is delivered by plugins. The downside is that you
won't get to see the full potential of vim at first. You have to wait till you
are able to install plugins and configure your vim.

**Top down**

Use a fully loaded vim with tons of modifications. If you want to go this way
you definitely should use [Janus](github.com/carlhuda/janus). That's the best
vim plugin distribution right now. Learn the basic movement commands and than
check the plugin list that is delivered with janus and try to use and learn
those plugins. The benefit of this is that your vim already has tons of syntax
highlighting and other stuff onboard and you just dive into it. The downside of
this approach is that you might get distracted and confused by all those
plugins and what they offer.

Whatever method you choose, you have to learn a lot of stuff. I would advise
you to use [this interactive learning tool](http://www.openvim.com/tutorial.html) 
to learn the first basic commands. After that you should try them till you
feel comfortable. The next step would be to  watch some of the
[Vimcasts](http://vimcasts.org/episodes/archive) and try to learn some of the
concepts shown in them.

After a few weeks you maybe need more tips and tricks to get to the next level
of vim. That will be the ideal time to read [Practical Vim: Edit Text at the Speed of Thought](http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/1934356980/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1638&creative=19454&creativeASIN=1934356980&linkCode=as2&tag=wannawork-21).
Don't read it before you haven't understood the basic concepts of vim. That
will be too early for you. It will confuse you. BUT if you have a basic
understanding of vim, this book is really awesome. You will learn so many new
things or see commands from a different angle. As I am writing this the book is
not done yet, but you can get access to it as a [beta book](http://pragprog.com/book/dnvim/practical-vim).

And for the emacs guys here: yes, there is a working tetris for vi, too:
[Tetris.vim](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=172) .
