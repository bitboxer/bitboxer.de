I finally found some time to update my [mt-daapd](http://www.mt-daapd.org/) RPM
for Suse 10.0 :

[mt-daapd-0.2.3-1.suse100.i586.rpm](/images/2006-01-15-mt_daapd_for_suse_10_0/mt-daapd-0.2.3-1.suse100.i586.rpm)

Install/Upgrade the RPM, edit the /etc/mt-daapd.conf to your needs
(MP3-Directory), go into the Runlevel-Editor of Yast and start the Service.
