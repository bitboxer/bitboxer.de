I am totally blown away. We are in [the top 10](http://railsrumble.com/entries/winners) of the
Rails Rumble 2013. Thanks to everyone who voted for us!

We created something I always dreamed of: a dictionary for sign language. One that would
enable everyone to add participate in it. A real crowd sourced solution to the problem
that is the recording of thousands of signs.

This is how it looks like:

If you want some technical backgrounds how we managed to pull this one in 48 hours,
you should read [Klaus blogpost](http://kaeff.net/posts/seemespeak-sign-language-dictionary-railsrumble-2013.html)
or [Florians post on the elastic search blog](http://www.elasticsearch.org/blog/tiny-data-rapid-development-with-elasticsearch/)
about it.
