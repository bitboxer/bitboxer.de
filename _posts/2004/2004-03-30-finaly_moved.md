I finaly moved to [MÃ¼nster](http://www.muenster.de). After weeks of hard work
my Apartment looks really great . The next thing for me will be to install the
Server and the video-pc for the living-room.

A lot of users mentioned a bug in
[JCalendar](http://sourceforge.net/projects/jcalendar) today. I have no time to
release a new version, but the fix is really simple. Look in the JCalendar
project-news for details...
