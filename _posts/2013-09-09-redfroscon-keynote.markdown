The keynote I gave at the [RedFrog Conf](http://ruby.froscon.org) is now online.

Be warned: that video is in German :wink: . 

<video class="video" controls="controls" poster="http://static.media.ccc.de/media/conferences/froscon/2013/hs6_-_2013-08-24_10_30_-_weck_den_geek_in_dir_-_bodo_tasche_-_1261_preview.jpg" width="640" height="360">

The slides are pretty readable on the video, but you if you have problems, 
you can read them here:

All other videos that have been recorded on the Froscon can be found on the
[media.cc.de](http://media.ccc.de/browse/conferences/froscon/2013/) server. I hadn't time to 
see the other talks, but there are a few on my watchlist.

And I think that I am speaking for the rest of the RedFrog Conf Team: the conference was 
awesome. The organization was flawless and it was the most easiest way to organize a subconference.
The only thing we had to do was to moderate our track. Thanks to the hard working Froscon Team for
this! We will try to do this again next year!
