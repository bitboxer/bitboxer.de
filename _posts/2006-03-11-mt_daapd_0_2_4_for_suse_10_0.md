I finally found some time to update my [mt-daapd RPM](http://www.mt-daapd.org/)
for Suse 10.0 :

[mt-daapd-0.2.4-1.suse100.i586.rpm](/images/2006-03-11-mt_daapd_0_2_4_for_suse_10_0/mt-daapd-0.2.4-1.i586.rpm)

Install/Upgrade the RPM, edit the /etc/mt-daapd.conf to your needs
(MP3-Directory), go into the Runlevel-Editor of Yast and start the Service.
