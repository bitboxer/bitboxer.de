If you know me, you know how much I love to work at [bitcrowd](http://bitcrowd.net). The people, the
projects, the energy of the team. Because of that the next sentence will sound
really surprising to you: I quit.

Yes, I quit bitcrowd. Effective immediately. And yes, I still love the company
and everyone involved. Sometimes it's just time to move on. To search for
new adventures. I already have plans for the next year, but I can't announce
them just yet. First I will do a small sabbatical till march and enjoy
my life.

I am really thankful for the last 3 years. I learned a lot and worked on amazing
projects with great people. It was a really great ride and will miss it a lot.

Bitcrowd is searching for Ruby/Elixir developers right now. Ping
[info@bitcrowd.net](mailto:info@bitcrowd.net) if you are interested. It's a
really unique place with lots of smart people working on fun projects.
