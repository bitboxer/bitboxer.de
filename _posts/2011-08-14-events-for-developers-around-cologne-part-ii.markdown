[Last year](http://bitboxer.de/2010/08/17/events-for-developers-around-cologne/) I
started [hacking-cologne.de](http://hacking-cologne.de), a calender for hacking
events around cologen. Now it is time to go a step further. I replaced the
google calender with a small rails app.

At the moment it's only a small app with the railscast default layout, but this
will change soon.

And this is how it looks like:
