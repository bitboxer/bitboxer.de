Currently I see a very worrying trend in the startup scene. A trend that
circumvents everything workers fought for in Germany. We finally will get a
minimum wage law in Germany on 1st of January 2015. But it looks like lots of
startups don't like that.

This is a quote from [Christoph Gerlinger of the German Startups Group](http://news.siliconallee.com/2014/06/20/guest-column-minimum-wage-plans-would-be-fatal-for-germanys-startup-scene/).

And for me this is pretty disgusting. Basically he says that his business
model is build on top of people that work for nearly nothing.

And it gets even worse. Why should you hire workers in the first place? Just
create a platform where you are an intermediary between the customer and your
workforce. Like Uber Pop, Helpling or others are doing right now.

This removes all sorts of problems:

* Minimum wage laws? Don't care. Those workers just have to take what we give
  them. Which translates to [$3 per hour with Uber](http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/some-uber-drivers-say-companys-promise-of-big-pay-day-doesnt-match-reality/2014/09/06/17f5d82c-224a-11e4-958c-268a320a60ce_story.html?Post%20generic=%3Ftid%3Dsm_twitter_washingtonpost).
* Social insurance contribution, health insurance? Those workers have to deal with those pesky
  things. Why do we need to deal with that? It's their health, not ours.
* Payed vacation? What? Don't know that word.
* Customers that have problems? Let them rate the worker and remove those
  with a rating [worse that 4.6 out of 5](http://priceonomics.com/are-one-star-reviews-for-assholes/)
  from the system. Job protection? Bwahahaha. Nope.
* Insurances for car accidents and other stuff? Oh, sure. The workers will deal
  with all of that. For sure. Pinky promise.

And the best of it all: you only pay your workers if they actually work. You don't need
to have workers "in stock" for peak demands.

I don't want this to be our future. The workers in Europe fought hard for
their rights. I want that startups take responsibilities for their workforce.
I want them to treat them as humans. As someone who earns respect. And out
of respect for your workforce you should pay them a decent wage and give
them all the things a worker can expect from a company.

The buzzword for this kind of startups is "the new sharing economy". And sharing
should also mean that you share your profits. And take responsibility.

Let's build a "caring economy" instead.
