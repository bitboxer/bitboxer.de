At the moment Chrome is the best browser on the market. It uses the fastest
rendering engine (Webkit) in combination with a very fast javascript engine.
But my most favored feature is not the speed, it's the extension system. Here I
will post a few I use  on a daily basis.

**Delicious Bookmarks Extension**

Sync your bookmarks with your delicious account. Not perfect, but a good start.
Hopefully this extension soon gets the all features of the firefox version.

**AdThwart**

The best ad blocker for chrome.

**RSS Subscription Extension**

Chrome can't handle rss feeds, this extension fixes that. Click and subscribe
in your google reader.

**Google Quick Scroll**

Highlights the text you searched for in pages you opened after clicking in the
google result list.

**Vimium**

Vim-Mode for Chrome. If you hate to use your mouse.

**Downloads**

Add a button to the toolbar for opening the download page.

If you want to keep track of all chrome extensions I use, you can subscribe to
my links on [Delicious tagged as Chrome](http://delicious.com/bodum/chrome).

**Nightly builds**

At the moment I am using the nightly builds of chrome to get the newest
features and the best speed.  I hated the manual installation process, so I
created a little shell script for my mac. You can get it in my github
repository: [chromium-install](http://github.com/bitboxer/chromium-install).
