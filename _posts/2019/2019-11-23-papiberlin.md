This month my little one has her second birthday. A lot has happened in
those two years. Sadly I didn't know enough fathers that shared my values
how to raise a kid. Fathers that are active, know important concepts like
mental load and want to share the workload and time with the kid evenly between
all people who are involved in raising the kid.

I am now trying to change that with a community I created called [Papi Berlin](https://papiberlin.de).
If you are a father and meet the description above, feel free to join our
[slack](https://papiberlin.de/pages/slack) or register for our [newsletter](https://papiberlin.de/newsletter). Starting in January 2020 we try to meet regularly.

Also if you are in the phase of becoming a dad, I will offer a course/workshop
to talk about all the things that you might want to know as a father. Register
for it [here](https://papiberlin.de/pages/beginner-kurs).
