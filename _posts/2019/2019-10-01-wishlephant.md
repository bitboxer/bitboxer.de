Last month [Anika](http://twitter.com/langziehohr) and I published a little
project we had been working on for the last 9 months:
[wishlephant](https://wishlephant.com).

It all started because we discovered how hard it is to manage your life with a
newborn. There are tons of things to make it easier. Apps you can use, books
you can read. But early one we discovered that there was one thing we couldn't
find a good solution for. We needed help managing the list of potential gifts
to prevent us having things we don't need or others twice.  An Amazon list
wasn't an option because of the obvious reasons. None of the other existing
solutions worked for us, so we decided to build our own.

And this is how it looks like:

Hope you have as much fun using it as we have.

In the next few weeks I will write about some of the things I build for this.
A lot of that will be open sourced. Cannot wait to talk about it in more details.
But now I have to take care of the little one.

Ps: If you want it as a sticker of our cute little logo, [ping me](https://twiter.com/bitboxer) :)
