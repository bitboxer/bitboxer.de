A couple of months ago I wrote a small tool that creates a RSS feed
of your IMDb ratings. This comes in handy if you want to use it with
[IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) or similar pipeline things. My use case is
to import them to [Day One](https://dayoneapp.com/) with this.

Interested? Just go [here](http://imdbrss.bitboxer.de/) and try it out.

Sorry for not posting this earlier. Someone asked me about a tool like this
and I realized I am really bad at promoting things I wrote :wink: .
