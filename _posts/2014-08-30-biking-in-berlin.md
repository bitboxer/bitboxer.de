A few years ago I filmed myself [biking in Cologne](https://vimeo.com/16737810) and
I thought it would be awesome to do it again here in Berlin.

This is the result:

Biking in Berlin is way better than in Cologne. Not as good as in MÃ¼nster, which
is one of the biking capitals here in Germany, but close.

Sadly the structure of Cologne is very narrow. Small streets without enough room for
bike lanes. And because of that biking there isn't fun. Berlin on the other side
has lots of huge streets. At least in the eastern part (where I am most of the time).
And you can see that in the video. Lots of bikers in the city.

Yes, it could be improved in a lot of places. But it's on a good way into the right direction.
