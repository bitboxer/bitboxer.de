My wife is currently opening a coworking space for parents called [little village](https://littlevillage.berlin/) and because of that, I investigated the topic a lot in the last couple of months. 

Parents have different needs than other people. They have kids. And if the kid is too young for a kindergarten or you couldn't manage to get a spot yet, you still need a place to work. These places are the ideal solution. Work on your stuff and your kid is in safe hands near you.

What was missing was a page with an overview of all coworking places all around the world. Luckily I already had a huge list of places and just needed to put them on a map. With the awesome little power tool that is [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) it was relatively easy to build. 

Please see for yourself: [coworkingforparents.org](https://coworkingforparents.org/map).
