My [mt-daapd](http://www.mt-daapd.org) had some problems with the new iTunes 5.
But thankfully Ron fixed the issues. Now my iTunes is able to connect with
mt-daapd again :D .

The new version:

[mt-daapd-0.2.2-1.suse93.i586.rpm](/images/2005-09-10-new_version_of_mt_daapd_for_itunes_5/mt-daapd-0.2.2-1.suse93.i586.rpm)

Attention: this is not the final 0.2.2. It's only a nightly build.

Install/Upgrade the RPM, edit the /etc/mt-daapd.conf to your needs
(MP3-Directory), go into the Runlevel-Editor of Yast and start the Service.

**The latest Version for Suse 10.0 can be found
