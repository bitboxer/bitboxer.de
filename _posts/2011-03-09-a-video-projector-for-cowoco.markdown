If you look at [hacking-cologne](http://hacking-cologne.de) you will see that a
lot of user group meetups are in a location called
[CoWoCo](http://www.coworkingcologne.de/). It's a really nice place with a lot
of friendly people and enough Club Mate and Afri Cola for everyone. But one
important thing is missing. A video projector.

This has to be fixed! If you want to help us, please consider donating here:

Thanks!

**Update:** Thanks to everyone who helped getting the money for the video projector!
