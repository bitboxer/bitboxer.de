It's time again for my list of talks that I loved on the chaos communication
congress. As usual I spent most time on
[RubyTown](https://twitter.com/ruby_town) and watched the talks later on.

In the last couple of weeks after the congress I watched tons of talks. More
than usual because of the amount of free time I am currently enjoying :wink: .

Here is a list of talks I loved in random order:

# Interplanetary Colonization

The big how, when and where questions about interplanetary colonization.
