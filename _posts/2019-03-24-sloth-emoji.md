Every year around summer new emojis appear on all of your devices. Have you
ever thought about how that happens? And how it works out that every device
understands them? Windows, Mac, Android, and iOS? 

The answer is simple. There is a committee for it. Of course there is. And this
one is called the [Unicode Consortium](https://unicode.org).

After listening to the [Macintosh
Podcast](https://www.macintosh.fm/episodes/emoji-1) episodes about how it all
works, I got curious if I could do that, too. It turns out that itâ€™s way easier
than I thought it would be. All that I needed to do was to write a
[proposal](https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2018/18074-sloth-emoji-.pdf) and sent it
in. Luckily I got lots of help by [Emojination](http://www.emojination.org/), a
slack chat of emoji enthusiasts. They helped to put the proposal into the right
shape (there is an official [Proposal
Format](https://www.unicode.org/emoji/proposals.html) you need to follow) and
through them I found [Kelly](https://web.library.yale.edu/pl/kelly-blanchat).
She made the finishing touches to my proposal that made it successful. 

After we send the proposal I just had to wait for it to go through a couple of
voting rounds to get it accepted in a bunch of subcommittees. In total it took 4
evenings of writing/rephrasing and 16 months of waiting.  The end result?
The [sloth emoji](https://emojipedia.org/sloth/).  

So all that is between your favorite missing emoji and it appearing on your
phone is just you writing a proposal. Do it! I am glad that I did.
