If you can read this, you are accessing [bitboxer.de](http://bitboxer.de) on my
new virtual server. Yeay!

I moved to [Host Europe](http://www.hosteurope.de) in 2010 and was kinda okay
with it. The server was fast enough, the service was okayish and everything
worked. What I really hated was the administration part of it.
[Plesk](http://www.parallels.com/products/plesk/) is a pain in the ass to use.
Totally cluttered and unintuitive. And the Host Europe Admin System (aka Kiss)
is nothing better.

A few weeks ago I heard about a hosting provider a few friends of mine are
using. At first I was kinda astonished that someone could talk with so much
passion about a hosting provider. Usually that's nothing to get passioned
about. Cluttered Interfaces, okayish support...why should I get in love with
something like that? But than I tried it for myself.

[Uberspace](https://uberspace.de) is different. I fell in love in the first few
minutes I tried it. They show how webhosting should be done. 

* Easy interface
* Create new accounts in seconds
* A complete ssh interface with everything that is important to me
  preconfigured. Starting from [htop](http://htop.sourceforge.net/) to
  [Midnight Commander](http://www.gnu.org/software/mc/) everything was there.
* Good performance (at least on the server I am running this on :wink: )
* Adding a new Mail Address is just one entry in the .qmail away
* They are open about the used [tech](http://uberspace.de/tech)
* The [wiki](http://uberspace.de/dokuwiki/) has tons of easy to understand
  articles
* Great support. Usually they answer within a really short time. Even on
  sundays. And the best thing about that: the answer is not a robot mail or
  from a sales guy.
* No strange artificial limits (e.g. as many databases as I need) as long as my
  quota of 10 gigabyte hard disc is not reached

And now one of the best parts: the pricing. It's up to you. The minimum price
is 1€ per uberspace per month. It's advised that you pay around 5-10€. I have
decided to pay 16€ for the service. And it's worth every penny of it. Why 16€?
That was the price I payed at Host Europe :smile: . After moving a few more domains
to uberspace, I will increase that even more. If you like something, you should
show it.

You should give them a try. The first 30 days are free!

Some tech facts:

* 10 gigabytes of space per uberspace
* Minimum of 1€ per uberspace per month, 1,50€ per uberspace with a domain (+
  5€ service charge for registering the domain). You also can register the
  domain somewhere else and connect that one to your uberspace for free
* 100 gigabytes of traffic per month per uberspace
* unlimited mysql databases (the disc quota is used to limit this), they are
  thinking on how to implement
  [PostgreSQL](http://uberspace.de/dokuwiki/brainstorming#postgresql)
* IPs in the logfiles are anonymized. They do everything they can to reduce the
  amount of data they have. They even don't have my adress and never asked for
  it.
* [Rails](http://uberspace.de/dokuwiki/cool:rails) and
  [node.js](http://uberspace.de/dokuwiki/development:nodejs) supported

If you have more questions about [Uberspace](https://uberspace.de) just ask
them :smile: .
