Today I gave a small lightning talk at the [Rug::B](http://berlin.onruby.de/) about
Ruby. Basically its a long list of stuff you can do with ruby besides websites.

There are lots of really big communities that somehow are not that known to
most ruby developers.

Maybe this gets you inspired:

And here is a long list of links for this talk:
