Phew, what a weekend. 48 hours of pure fun at the [Rails Rumble](http://railsrumble.com/).
Rails What?! For all of you who don't know what the Rails Rumble is: it is a
contest for Rails developers. Implement an awesome idea in 48 hours and win
prizes while doing so. Awesome, right? Out of the 500 teams who participated,
around 300 got a working version of their idea...well, mostly working ;) .

Our idea was to create a working geocoder for
[OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org). A geocoder can reference an
address like "Bergstr. 1, 50789 KÃ¶ln" to a point on a map. There are a few
geocoders available for the [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org), but
sadly they have tons of problems. Ours does not :smile: . You can find it at
[happy-geoco.de](http://happy-geoco.de).

If you are interested in the technical background, Klaus wrote a [nice article](http://klaustopher.github.com/blog/2012/10/15/how-to-start-your-own-geocoder-in-48-hours/)
about it. Worth a read!
