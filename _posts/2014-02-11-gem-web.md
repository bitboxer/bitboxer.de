Two weeks ago I stumbled upon a nice little script in [Michael Grosserâ€™s Dotfiles](https://github.com/grosser/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/gem-github).
That little script helps to open the webpage of a gem. It gets the information from [rubygems](https://rubygems.org) and
opens a browsers with the webpage configured in the gemspec.

I thought this Idea was really great and upgraded the code to a rubygem plugin. To install the plugin enter
the following line into your terminal:

```bash
$ gem install gem-web
```

To open the github page of the Ruby on Rails project, just enter this:

```bash
$ gem web rails
```

The plugin can also open the webpage or the documentation, if it is configured in the gemspec.

```bash
Options:
  -g, --github                     Open github page of gem, this searches all urls for a github page. This is the default.
  -c, --sourcecode                 Open sourcecode gem
  -d, --doc                        Open documentation of gem
  -w, --webpage                    Open webpage of gem
```

You can find the code of this Gem on [Github](https://github.com/bitboxer/gem-web).
