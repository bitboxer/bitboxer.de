A couple of years ago I was lucky to be in the first round of the [Prototype Fund](https://prototypefund.de/) and was able to build [SignDict](https://signdict.org). A German sign language dictionary that now has around 88,500 unique visitors a month and is one of the leading sign dictionaries in Germany.

I couldn't believe my luck when I got accepted to the 9th round with another project. Starting this month I will be working on a project called [Hier Baut Berlin](http://hierbautberlin.de) while being paid by the German government.

So, what does it do? It will help you see what the city of Berlin is doing in your local neighborhood. After you opened the site and specified a location, it will show you all construction projects and other things that the city
has planned or is building in your area at the moment. Additionally, you can also subscribe to that neighborhood and will be notified via email when new entries have been added.

From now on, I will post progress reports every two weeks on the blog at [blog.hierbautberlin.de](https://blog.hierbautberlin.de).

If you want you can also follow all updates on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/HierBautBerlin) or [GitHub](https://github.com/hierbautberlin/website).
