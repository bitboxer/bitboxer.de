<p>If you can read this, you are accessing <a href="http://bitboxer.de">bitboxer.de</a> on my
new virtual server. Yeay!</p>

<p>I moved to <a href="http://www.hosteurope.de">Host Europe</a> in 2010 and was kinda okay
with it. The server was fast enough, the service was okayish and everything
worked. What I really hated was the administration part of it.
<a href="http://www.parallels.com/products/plesk/">Plesk</a> is a pain in the ass to use.
Totally cluttered and unintuitive. And the Host Europe Admin System (aka Kiss)
is nothing better.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago I heard about a hosting provider a few friends of mine are
using. At first I was kinda astonished that someone could talk with so much
passion about a hosting provider. Usually that&#39;s nothing to get passioned
about. Cluttered Interfaces, okayish support...why should I get in love with
something like that? But than I tried it for myself.</p>

<p><a href="https://uberspace.de">Uberspace</a> is different. I fell in love in the first few
minutes I tried it. They show how webhosting should be done. </p>

<ul>
<li>Easy interface</li>
<li>Create new accounts in seconds</li>
<li>A complete ssh interface with everything that is important to me
preconfigured. Starting from <a href="http://htop.sourceforge.net/">htop</a> to
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/mc/">Midnight Commander</a> everything was there.</li>
<li>Good performance (at least on the server I am running this on ;) )</li>
<li>Adding a new Mail Address is just one entry in the .qmail away</li>
<li>They are open about the used <a href="http://uberspace.de/tech">tech</a></li>
<li>The <a href="http://uberspace.de/dokuwiki/">wiki</a> has tons of easy to understand
articles</li>
<li>Great support. Usually they answer within a really short time. Even on
sundays. And the best thing about that: the answer is not a robot mail or
from a sales guy.</li>
<li>No strange artificial limits (e.g. as many databases as I need) as long as my
quota of 10 gigabyte hard disc is not reached</li>
</ul>

<p>And now one of the best parts: the pricing. It&#39;s up to you. The minimum price
is 1€ per uberspace per month. It&#39;s advised that you pay around 5-10€. I have
decided to pay 16€ for the service. And it&#39;s worth every penny of it. Why 16€?
That was the price I payed at Host Europe :) . After moving a few more domains
to uberspace, I will increase that even more. If you like something, you should
show it.</p>

<p>You should give them a try. The first 30 days are free!</p>

<p>Some tech facts:</p>

<ul>
<li>10 gigabytes of space per uberspace</li>
<li>Minimum of 1€ per uberspace per month, 1,50€ per uberspace with a domain (+
5€ service charge for registering the domain). You also can register the
domain somewhere else and connect that one to your uberspace for free</li>
<li>100 gigabytes of traffic per month per uberspace</li>
<li>unlimited mysql databases (the disc quota is used to limit this), they are
thinking on how to implement
<a href="http://uberspace.de/dokuwiki/brainstorming#postgresql">PostgreSQL</a></li>
<li>IPs in the logfiles are anonymized. They do everything they can to reduce the
amount of data they have. They even don&#39;t have my adress and never asked for
it.</li>
<li><a href="http://uberspace.de/dokuwiki/cool:rails">Rails</a> and
<a href="http://uberspace.de/dokuwiki/development:nodejs">node.js</a> supported</li>
</ul>

them :) .</p>
